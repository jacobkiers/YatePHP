YatePHP is a PHP library to work with Yate (http://yate.null.ro/)

== Requirements ==
YatePHP can only be used with PHP 5.3 or higher, since it uses PHP 5.3 specific
elements. Furthermore, it might be smart to have an installation of Yate around.

== License ==
YatePHP is licensed under the terms of the New BSD license. A copy of this
license can be found in the LICENSE.txt file.

== Contributing ==
Feel free to contribute to YatePHP. If you do so, please fork this project and
create a pull request when you're ready, or contact me to send your patch.

When you contribute code, please follow the Zend Framework Coding Guidelines.
You can find them on the Zend Framework website:

I won't require a transfer of copyright (also known as a Contributer License
Agreement), but please make sure you have the permission to contribute. I will
only include patches which are also subject to the New BSD license.
